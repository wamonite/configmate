Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Configmate.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.

$ pip install Configmate
------------------------

To install configmate, simply run this simple command in your terminal of choice::

    $ pip install configmate

If you don't have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ installed,
`this Python installation guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_
can guide you through the process.

Get the Source Code
-------------------

Configmate is developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/wamonite/configmate>`_.

You can either clone the public repository::

    $ git clone git://github.com/wamonite/configmate.git

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python
package, or install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ cd configmate
    $ pip install .
